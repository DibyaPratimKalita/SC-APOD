# SC-APOD
This project was created to bring satisfaction to Space Club enthusiasts all over the world. The scope of the app is that users/visitors can visit the web app and send a request based on a date input to view a picture of the day which depicts an occurence in space with an explanation which provides more information about the occurence. To make the web app more aesthetically pleasing, a background picker is present for users/vistors to choose whichever one they prefer. Also, upon requesting for an APOD, the background image of the web app changes to match the APOD
